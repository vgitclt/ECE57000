This growth was primarily driven by a 56% increase in Gross Bookings, with Delivery Gross Bookings growing by 71% and Mobility Gross Bookings growing by 38%. The increase in revenue was also attributed to higher demand for food delivery orders and increased trip volumes as the business recovered from the impacts of COVID-19.

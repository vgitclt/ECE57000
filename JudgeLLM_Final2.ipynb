        "Judging generated texts is tricky — whether it's a “simple” summary or a chatbot conversation. Metrics like accuracy don’t work well because there are many ways to be “right” without exactly matching the example answer. And things like style or tone are subjective and hard to pin down.\n",
        "Humans can handle these nuances, but manually reviewing every response doesn’t scale. LLM-as-a-judge emerged as an alternative: you can use LLMs to evaluate the generated texts. Interestingly, the LLM is both the source of the problem and the solution!"

The center also features a canoe pageant, where different island nations showcase their unique styles of canoeing. It was truly a feast for the senses and a fascinating insight into the diverse cultures of the Pacific.\\n\\nNext up was a trip to the North Shore, which boasts some of the best surf spots in the world. I watched in awe as surfers of all levels tackled the massive waves, and even had the chance to take a lesson myself. It was an exhilarating experience, and I left with a newfound respect for the power of the ocean.\\n\\nOf course, no trip to Hawaii would be complete without a visit to Pearl Harbor. The somber memorial serves as a reminder of the sacrifices made during World War II, and it was a deeply moving experience to pay my respects to the brave men and women who lost their lives on that fateful day.\\n\\nLast but not least, I made sure to indulge in some of the local cuisine. From poke bowls to shave ice, the flavors of Hawaii are truly unique and delicious. A personal favorite was the plate lunch, which typically consists of a protein, rice, and macaroni salad. It may not be the healthiest option, but it sure is tasty!\\n\\nOverall, my trip to Hawaii was an unforgettable experience. The cultural immersion, natural beauty, and delicious food all contributed to an incredible adventure.
